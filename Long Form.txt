Q: What is the recommended maximum number of attempts before lockout according to the 2019 NIST guidelines?
   Answer: There is no specific recommended maximum number of attempts, but organizations should consider factors such as the sensitivity of the information being protected and the likelihood of an attack.
   Hint: Locking out users after too many failed attempts can help prevent brute force attacks.
   Followup: What are some other ways organizations can protect against brute force attacks?

 Q: Which type of online guessing barrier involves limiting the number of guesses an attacker can make in a certain amount of time?
   Answer: Rate-limiting
   Hint: This barrier slows down attackers and makes it harder for them to guess passwords.
   Followup: How can organizations determine what rate limits to set?

 Q: What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?
   Answer: Using two different methods to verify identity before granting access to an account.
   Hint: This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
   Followup: What are some common methods used for two-factor authentication?

 Q: Which factor determines how good a password is?
   Answer: The randomness of the password generation process.
   Hint: A truly random password is much harder to guess than one that follows a pattern or uses personal information.
   Followup: How can users ensure that their passwords are random?

 Q: What are some best practices for creating strong passwords?
    Answer: Using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in your password; avoiding personal information in your password; using unique passwords for each account you have; and making sure your password generation process is random.
    Hint: A strong password should be complex and unique.
    Followup: How often should users change their passwords?

 Q: Which type of online attack involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information?
    Answer: Social engineering attack
    Hint: This type of attack relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits.
    Followup: What are some common examples of social engineering attacks?

 Q: What is the purpose of a blocklist in password security?
    Answer: To prevent users from using frequently used passwords.
    Hint: A blocklist can help prevent attackers from guessing common passwords.
    Followup: How often should organizations update their blocklists?

Q: What is sandboxing?
A. Giving each program its own file and memory separate from any other program, so that it is free to do things within its own confined space.

Q: How might sandboxing via virtual machines fail?
A: There are a number of answers, but deliberately lagging the system and timing the system to see if other fellow CPU-laggers are on the system was a method discussed in class.

Q: What is a VPN good for?
A: Obscuring your identity from eavesdroppers by rerouting your communications through a third party server.

Q: What are some of the problems with VPNs?
