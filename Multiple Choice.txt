Q: Which security design principle suggests that a simpler design is more secure because it is easier to analyze, test, and validate? 
A. Economy of mechanism 
B. Fail-safe defaults 
C. Psychological acceptability 
D. Open design

Q: Which security design principle suggests that older protocols, tools, paradigms, etc. that are still used are more secure?

A. Economy of mechanism
B. Fail-safe defaults 
C. Psychological acceptability 
D. Time-tested tools
