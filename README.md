# CPSC-329-Insecurity-Quiz
This project consists of a quiz program that will test the user on the security topics covered in CPSC 329. The project will also implement various security applications, little ‘gotchas’ which demonstrate security issues or concepts, that will be present while the user is completing the quiz. This project can be used as a tool for review of the security content covered in CPSC 329 and will showcase how the security ideas learned can actually be applied.

# Course content covered:
All of the topics discussed in class have been covered. There are four questions for each notes package. See the QuizQuestionsFinal.csv for all of the questions.

# Security gotchas:
1. Cryptography: Asks for you to decrypt a cipher text before giving access to the quiz.
2. Passwords: Asks for you to input your login information, but then reveals that you shouldn't do this unless you trust the source! 
3. Keylogger: Logs your keys and outputs it to YOUR_KEYS_LOGGED.txt
4. Networking: The keys logged are actually sent OVER a network connection, which luckily for you is on the same computer. In principle however, this program can steal your data!
