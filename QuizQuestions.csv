Numerical,What is the recommended minimum number of attempts before lockout according to the 2019 NIST guidelines?,,10,This is also the number of fingers on two hands.,Why do you suppose this is?
Numerical,How many computers can be given a unique IP in the network 10.0.0.0/24?,,255,You loose one thanks to the router!,
ShortAnswer,What is the recommended maximum number of attempts before lockout according to the 2019 NIST guidelines?,,"There is no specific recommended maximum number of attempts, but organizations should consider factors such as the sensitivity of the information being protected and the likelihood of an attack.",,
ShortAnswer,Which type of online guessing barrier involves limiting the number of guesses an attacker can make in a certain amount of time?,,Rate-limiting,This barrier slows down attackers and makes it harder for them to guess passwords.,
ShortAnswer,What is two-factor authentication (2FA)?,,Using two different methods to verify identity before granting access to an account.,This adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password.,
ShortAnswer,Which factor determines how good a password is?,,The randomness of the password generation process.,A truly random password is much harder to guess than one that follows a pattern or uses personal information.,
ShortAnswer,What are some best practices for creating strong passwords?,,"Using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in your password; avoiding personal information in your password; using unique passwords for each account you have; and making sure your password generation process is random.",A strong password should be complex and unique.,
ShortAnswer,Which type of online attack involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information?,,Social engineering attack,This type of attack relies on psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits.,
ShortAnswer,What is the purpose of a blocklist in password security?,,To prevent users from using frequently used passwords.,A blocklist can help prevent attackers from guessing common passwords.,
ShortAnswer,What is sandboxing?,,"Giving each program its own file and memory separate from any other program, so that it is free to do things within its own confined space.",,
ShortAnswer,How might sandboxing via virtual machines fail?,,"There are a number of answers, but deliberately lagging the system and timing the system to see if other fellow CPU-laggers are on the system was a method discussed in class.",,
ShortAnswer,Name three operating systems based on UNIX.,,"Many possible answers, but we have MacOS, Ubuntu, and Debian",,
ShortAnswer,Why is sudo usage logged on a UNIX system?,,"Accountability, so that whoever owns the system can keep track of what's being done on the system, to improve security...",,
ShortAnswer,Can you change your MAC address?,,Yes,,
ShortAnswer,What is NMap used for?,,"Scanning a network for open ports, vulnerabilities, active machines, etc...",,
ShortAnswer,What is a VPN good for?,,Obscuring your identity from eavesdroppers by rerouting your communications through a third party server.,,
ShortAnswer,What are some of the problems with VPNs?,,"You need to trust the VPN, Use of one may be suspicious, VPNs can be painfully slow, VPNs can be costly, doesn't help if the website you want to visit is itself dangerous (gives you malicious files), etc.",,
MultipleChoice,What are the three elements of the security triad?,"Confidentiality, integrity, and availability|Authentication, authorization, and accounting |Encryption, decryption, and hashing |None of the above",A,American Espionage Agency,"The security triad is a fundamental concept in security that involves three key elements: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure, integrity ensures that the data is accurate and unaltered, and availability ensures that the data is accessible when needed."
MultipleChoice,"Which security design principle suggests that a simpler design is more secure because it is easier to analyze, test, and validate?",Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Open design,A,Cut down the excess.,"Economy of mechanism is a security design principle that suggests that the simplest design is often the most secure. This is because complex designs can be difficult to analyze and test, making them more prone to errors and vulnerabilities."
MultipleChoice,Which security design principle suggests that security mechanisms should not rely on the ignorance of potential attackers?,Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Open design,D,This principle suggests that security mechanisms should be designed to withstand attacks even if the attackers have knowledge of how the system works.,"Security mechanisms should not rely on the ignorance of potential attackers, because you cannot guarantee attackers won't be able to obtain this knowledge."
MultipleChoice,"Which security design principle suggests that a secure human interface should be designed for ease of use, else people wouldn't use it?",Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Open design,C,"If it's too complicated, I'd find a way to not use it...","Psychological acceptability is a security design principle that suggests that a secure human interface should be designed for ease of use, so people will use it. If people won't use it, it isn't securing anything."
MultipleChoice,What is patchwork security?,A unified framework for approaching security|Addressing individual threats with different solutions|A method for building a secure system|None of the above,B,"Patchwork security involves using different security measures to address different threats, rather than adopting a unified approach to security.",Patchwork security is a reactive approach to security that involves addressing individual threats with different solutions rather than adopting a unified security framework.
MultipleChoice,Who are the 'bad guys' in terms of security?,"Business competitors, trolls, criminals, government cyberwarriors, and more|Only government cyberwarriors|Only criminals|None of the above",A,"In terms of security, the 'bad guys' are individuals or organizations that seek to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access to systems or data.","In terms of security, 'bad guys' refer to anyone who poses a threat to the security of a system, which could be anyone depending on the context."
MultipleChoice,"Which security design principle suggests that older protocols, tools, paradigms, etc. that are still used are more secure?",Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Time-tested tools,D,This principle suggests that older security tools and protocols may be more secure because they have been tested and proven effective over time. Even Han Dynasty Chinese swords were judged on this basis!,"Time-tested tools is a security design principle that suggests that older protocols, tools, paradigms, etc. that are still in use are often more secure. This is because they have been around for a long time and have been thoroughly tested, making it less likely that vulnerabilities will be discovered."
