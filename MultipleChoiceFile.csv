MultipleChoice,What are the three elements of the security triad?,"Confidentiality, integrity, and availability|Authentication, authorization, and accounting |Encryption, decryption, and hashing |None of the above ",A,American Espionage Agency,"The security triad is a fundamental concept in security that involves three key elements: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality refers to the protection of sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure, integrity ensures that the data is accurate and unaltered, and availability ensures that the data is accessible when needed."
MultipleChoice,"Which security design principle suggests that a simpler design is more secure because it is easier to analyze, test, and validate?",Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Open design,A,Cut down the excess.,"Economy of mechanism is a security design principle that suggests that the simplest design is often the most secure. This is because complex designs can be difficult to analyze and test, making them more prone to errors and vulnerabilities."
MultipleChoice,Which security design principle suggests that security mechanisms should not rely on the ignorance of potential attackers?,Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Open design,D,This principle suggests that security mechanisms should be designed to withstand attacks even if the attackers have knowledge of how the system works.,"Security mechanisms should not rely on the ignorance of potential attackers, because you cannot guarantee attackers won't be able to obtain this knowledge."
MultipleChoice,"Which security design principle suggests that a secure human interface should be designed for ease of use, else people wouldn't use it?",Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Open design,C,"If it's too complicated, I'd find a way to not use it...","Psychological acceptability is a security design principle that suggests that a secure human interface should be designed for ease of use, so people will use it. If people won't use it, it isn't securing anything."
MultipleChoice,What is patchwork security?,A unified framework for approaching security|Addressing individual threats with different solutions|A method for building a secure system|None of the above,B,"Patchwork security involves using different security measures to address different threats, rather than adopting a unified approach to security.",Patchwork security is a reactive approach to security that involves addressing individual threats with different solutions rather than adopting a unified security framework.
MultipleChoice,Who are the 'bad guys' in terms of security?,"Business competitors, trolls, criminals, government cyberwarriors, and more|Only government cyberwarriors|Only criminals|None of the above",A,"In terms of security, the 'bad guys' are individuals or organizations that seek to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access to systems or data.","In terms of security, 'bad guys' refer to anyone who poses a threat to the security of a system, which could be anyone depending on the context."
MultipleChoice,"Which security design principle suggests that older protocols, tools, paradigms, etc. that are still used are more secure?",Economy of mechanism|Fail-safe defaults|Psychological acceptability|Time-tested tools,D,This principle suggests that older security tools and protocols may be more secure because they have been tested and proven effective over time. Even Han Dynasty Chinese swords were judged on this basis!,"Time-tested tools is a security design principle that suggests that older protocols, tools, paradigms, etc. that are still in use are often more secure. This is because they have been around for a long time and have been thoroughly tested, making it less likely that vulnerabilities will be discovered."
